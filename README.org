stuff to deal with mendeley.

there is one script at the moment

* BibDesk file importer, if you are jumping ship from BibDesk

if you have a bunch of files linked inside BibDesk and want to save some time importing them into mendeley

use this script after you did File > open [your bibdesk file] from mendeley

if you have lots of dupes from the import, see [[http://simon.net.nz/articles/deleting-duplicate-records-in-mendeley/]]

insert_file.py will read through your bibdesk file and look for (pdf|PDF|xoj) files, try to find matching documents by title in your mendeley database

modify the regexp to detect other files like doc.

if it finds a match, and does not see a matching file hash in the sqlite db, it tries to insert it

*the file hash in the mendeley db is simply a SHA1 on the binary data of the file*

if you have multiple files, it says so, and doesn't insert. you can easily modify it so that it does insert.

so after you modify the two paths:
  - PATH_TO_BIBDESK_BIB = the .bib file
  - PATH_TO_MENDELEY_DB = the .sqlite file, if you use a mac it should be /User/yourname/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/youremail@yourdomain.com@www.mendeley.com.sqlite (if you didn't create an online account i think it's called online.sqlite)

then:
  - *BACKUP YOUR .sqlite FILE BEFORE RUNNING!!!*
  - *also make sure you quit Mendeley Desktop before running!*
  - run python insert_file.py. if you don't supply the mendeley db path it will just read through the bib file and print out what it found
  - reopen Mendeley, hopefully your files got linked!
